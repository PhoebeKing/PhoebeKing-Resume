        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born and raised in the small European country of Belgium. I later moved to the United States at the age of 9. From a very young age, I always had a knack for art. I started out as mere doodling, stick figures at most, but it steadily grew to more detailed portraits and imaginative figures. I didn’t think much of it since when you’re younger you don’t tend to draw things with a purpose. However, as my passion grew, I found myself wanting to share my work with others. My goal oriented towards making others around me happy and smiling. At first, it was just my parents and family, but it gradually grew to teachers and staff at my elementary schools. Seeing others down in the dumps upset me, so if my art can brighten up their day, I would draw until they were smiling.<br><br>

        A pivotal moment for me in my art career was during middle school. This is where I was truly challenged in the art field by the level of complexity. We were being taught different styles and techniques, being challenged by our teacher to apply them to form our own artistic voice. During this time, I journaled which styles I liked and which techniques worked well for me, detailing my dislikes about certain things that I tried. In other words, a full analysis of my progression through the art classes in my middle school educational career. After I graduated from middle school, I had created a rough outline of my art style. All that was needed was some fine-tuning. High school rolled around, and I had to choose what I wanted to pursue; what classes I would be taking to better myself. So, I ultimately took classes that would better me into the career path that I want to pursue: Intro to Art, and Intro to 3D Animation. Intro to Art helped me fine-tune my drawing and painting, while Intro to 3D Animation helped me get a grasp on the virtual art world. I took several other art classes throughout high school; however, these were the most impactful classes I took.<br><br>

        After these formative years, I have continued to learn and improve. Currently, I am studying at University of California Riverside in the arts as an Art Studio major. I enjoy all types of art, from painting & pencil drawing to ceramic sculptures. I would ultimately like to work in the animation business for Pixar or Disney but am also interested in possibly being in the teaching field as an art teacher.
